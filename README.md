# Titan Fitness Tracker App - Documentation
A web application for Purdue Students that seamlessly combines exercise and nutrition tracking while offering intelligent, personalized suggestions to guide users' health and fitness journeys üçéüèãÔ∏è.


## Workspace Setup
To clone the repository onto your local machine, run `git clone https://github.com/youngbryanyu/titan-health-app.git` in the directory you want the repository to be cloned into.

We used [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager for our application. Install yarn by running `npm install yarn`. We will be managing the versions of node modules separately for front and backend. Next, navigate to both the `/backend` and `/frontend` directories run `yarn` in both to install all the necessary node module dependencies. <ins>If you accidentally ran `yarn` in the root directory instead of in the `/backend` and `/frontend` directories, delete the `/node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` files and make sure to run `yarn` in the proper directories.<ins>

## Running the Application

### Set up the environment Variables
The environment variables for the backend server will need to be configured before running the application. See the [Environment Variables for the Backend Server](https://github.com/youngbryanyu/titan-health-app/blob/main/README.md#environment-variables-for-the-backend-server) section for steps on setting up the `.env` file for environment variables.

### Running the Backend (Server)
Navigate to the `/backend` directory. Before starting the server, run `yarn` to update existing node modules or install any missing node module dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to start the backend server. 

### Running the Frontend (Client)
Navigate to the `/frontend` directory. Before starting the server, run `yarn` to update existing node modules or install any missing node module dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to start the backend server. The default IP address and port number set by the application is `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Development

For more details on how to use yarn as a package manager, see the [yarn CLI documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/).

### Installing New Modules (Dependencies)
To install a new dependency required, navigate to either the frontend or backend directory, then run `yarn add <module_name>` to install the new module in its desired location. Use the `--dev` flag to add a dev dependency instead of a dependency. Make sure to not install dependencies in the project root directory, but rather in either the `/frontend` or `/backend` directories. If you accidentally ran installed a dependency in the root directory instead of in the `/backend` and `/frontend` directories, delete the `/node_modules` directory and yarn.lock files and make sure to run `yarn add ...` in the proper directory.

### MongoDB Setup (For Database Access)
We have set up a MongoDB cluster though MongoDB Atlas, hosted on AWS. Follow the below steps to make sure you are setup for development. ~~The necessary credentials are contained in the [credentials document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyIoMjj3yVY9TDJR9R39AVFLrzpDo_KEBhMqWR9ADTs/edit) which is private (must request access)~~. 

> :warning: See [/backend/.env.example](./backend/.env.example) for the required environment variables that you will need to setup to run your own instance of the backend. You will need to create your own MongoDB instance and make up your own encryption key. You will need to set up your own MongoDB atlas instance and configure the steps below.

#### Setting Up Network Access for your IP Address
1. Navigate to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) and log into the Titan Health App account using the credentials in the [credentials document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyIoMjj3yVY9TDJR9R39AVFLrzpDo_KEBhMqWR9ADTs/edit). Select the Titan Health App organization and project.
2. Under the `SECURITY` section on the left, go to `Quickstart`, and scroll down to `Add entries to your IP Access List`. Simply click `Add My Current IP Address`, and your device's IP will be granted access to the Database cluster (you may need to repeat this step if you're IP address is dynamically assigned and changes, or you're on a different network). You can also add your IP in to the access list in the `Network Access` section but it's easier to do it through `Quickstart`.

Note: currently we have enabled allowing all IP addresses to access the database cluster.

#### Database Access (Users and Roles)
There already exists two users that each assume 1 default role. They're set up to be authenticated simply through credentials which are contained in the [credentials document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyIoMjj3yVY9TDJR9R39AVFLrzpDo_KEBhMqWR9ADTs/edit).
1. ReadWriteUser - has read and write access to the database cluster. (<ins>Stick with this user for development<ins>)
2. AdminUser - has full administrator access to the database cluster.

#### Connecting to the Database
The URI and credentials to connect to the database cluster are contained in the [credentials document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XyIoMjj3yVY9TDJR9R39AVFLrzpDo_KEBhMqWR9ADTs/edit). For ease of visualizing the data while working with it, we recommend downloading [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) and connecting through Compass to visualize the databases and collections during development.

The collections of data relevant to the application will all be stored under the `TitanHealthApp` database within the database cluster.

### Environment Variables for the Backend Server
Like mentioned earlier in the section about how to run the application locally, the environment variables will need to be set up in the `.env` file. The file `.env.example` under `/backend` is provided as a template for the `.env` environment variables file. `.env` will need to be populated with necessary keys and credentials, and is kept empty on the repository because it contains confidential keys and credentials. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iOqG89USP2q-z9TD6mlgi7BTrqrQT_RX3JRDlZpyVYg/edit) for the .env file we are using to run and test our application locally (file is private and must request access). 

<ins>Do not push changes in `.env` to any remote branch. If you add a new environment variable simply add it to the `.env.example` template file with a temporary value. To prevent accidental pushes of the `.env` file, I recommend running `git update-index --assume-unchanged **/backend/.env`, which tells git to ignore changes in . More about this is in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18276951/how-do-i-stop-git-from-tracking-any-changes-to-a-file-from-this-commit-forward) stackoverflow post.<ins>

## Future Updates and Goals
- Improve UI and visual experience for users.
- Create more comprehensive recommendation system
- Create more useful health and fitness features, as most features are skewed towards nutrition currently.
- Improve robustness and user input validation of application on some pages.
